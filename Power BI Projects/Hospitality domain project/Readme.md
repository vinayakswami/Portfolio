# Project Title: AtliQ Hotels Hospatility Project
# Overview
📌 This project is part of Codebasics Reume challenge. It covers an overview analysis on AtliQ Hotels Revenue,business performance, booking patterns, and customer preferences.

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. 
Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. 
As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.
Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.
