# Project: Supply Chain Dashboard

# Project Overview

As part of the codebasics  resume challenge, I have worked on this analysis project.It covers an overview of AtliQ Mart Business performance, Customer Analysis & Delivery Anlysis.

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodra. They want to expand to other metro/tier1 cities in the next 2 years.

AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend the annual contract due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the â€™On timeâ€™ and â€˜In Fullâ€™ delivery service level for all the customers on a daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.

The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure â€˜on-time delivery (OT) %â€™, â€˜In-full delivery (IF) %â€™ and OnTime in full (OTIF) % of the customer orders on a daily basis against the target service level set for each customer.

ðŸ“Œ Performance Gap with Targets: There is a Huge gap between the actual performance and the target metrics for On-time Delivery (OT%), In-full Delivery (IF%), and On Time In Full (OTIF%) metrics. This indicates a need for improvement in operational efficiency and order fulfillment processes.<br>
ðŸ“Œ Focus on Line Fill Rate (LIFR): The Line Fill Rate (LIFR) is at 66%, indicating room for improvement in product availability and inventory management. AtliqMart should focus on optimizing inventory levels and ensuring that products are adequately stocked to meet customer demand.<br>
ðŸ“Œ Improvements in OTIF%: The OTIF% metric shows a gap of nearly 30% from the target, indicating a need to improve order fulfillment and delivery processes. AtliqMart should streamline its logistics operations to ensure timely and complete deliveries to customers.<br>
ðŸ“Œ Addressing Late Deliveries: Approximately 40% of orders are delivered late, with an average delay of 2 days. AtliqMart should identify the root causes of late deliveries and take corrective actions to minimize delays, such as optimizing delivery routes and schedules or improving communication with suppliers.<br>
ðŸ“Œ Category-wise Analysis: Dairy products account for the majority of orders, suggesting strong demand in this category. AtliqMart could capitalize on this trend by expanding its product offerings or promotions in the dairy category to drive sales further.<br>
ðŸ“Œ Customer and Product Performance: Customers like Lotus Mart, Coolblue, and Acclaimed stores have the highest orders but also face challenges in delivering products on time. AtliqMart should work closely with these suppliers to improve their performance and explore alternative suppliers if necessary. Products like Butter, Milk, and Ghee are frequently delayed, indicating potential issues in the supply chain or inventory management for these items. AtliqMart should prioritize addressing these issues to enhance customer satisfaction.<br>
ðŸ“Œ Continuous Improvement: Despite the insights gained, there are no noticeable improvements in key metrics over the past few months. AtliqMart should establish a culture of continuous improvement, regularly reviewing performance metrics, identifying areas for enhancement, and implementing corrective actions to drive positive changes.<br>
ðŸ“Œ Overall, AtliqMart should focus on enhancing operational efficiency, optimizing inventory management, and strengthening partnerships with suppliers to improve order fulfillment and customer satisfaction. By addressing these areas, AtliqMart can drive better performance and achieve its business objectives.<br>
